The Taguchi method and ANOVA were used to determine the effects of travel speed, wire feed rate, current, and argon flow rate on the responses including bead shape and size, bead roughness, oxidation levels, melt through depth, and the microstructure. Travel speed and current were found to have the largest effect on the responses. Increasing travel speed or decreasing current caused a decrease in melt through depth and an increase in roughness. Printing strategies were tested using specimens of multiple layers and no significant difference was found between printing layers in the same direction and printing layers in alternating directions. No observable interface between the layers was present suggesting a complete fusion between layers with no oxidation. Three distinct zones were identified within the three- and eightlayer samples. The zones were characterized by the size and distribution of the molybdenum carbide formations within the matrix grain formations.}, journal={Additive Manufacturing}, author={Dinovitzer, Malcolm and Chen, Xiaohu and Laliberte, Jeremy and Huang, Xiao and Frei, Hanspeter}, year={2019}, month=mar, pages={138–146}, language={en} }

In the current work, Fe–Co-based crystalline monolayer coatings with ultra-high saturation magnetization (Ms) above 1.9T were facilely fabricated on AISI 1010 substrate, using (Fe0.8Co0.2)85B14Si1 (at\%) self-ﬂuxing alloy as feedstock powders of a co-axial powder feeding plasma-transferred arc (PTA) welding. The phase assemblage, microstructure, hardness, and magnetic properties were investigated, and the welding parameters were optimized using orthogonal experiment. The results show that the optimal powder ﬂow rate, welding current, and speed were 24 g/min, 118 A, and 0.13 m/min, respectively. The optimum coating C9 has a eutectic-dendrite composite structure and the sorbite dendritic cores included in network-like (a-Fe?(Fe1-xCox)2B) eutectics. The body-centered cubic (b.c.c.) a-Fe multielement solid solution causes a high Ms of 1.96 ± 0.004T. While a high coercivity (Hc) of 38.9 ± 0.2Oe and microhardness of 4.58 ± 0.23GPa result from (Fe1-xCox)2B in eutectics. This work conﬁrms the feasibility and potential of high-Ms soft magnetic coatings fabricated by conventional co-axial powder feeding PTA welding and facilitates their extended applications in some special ﬁelds, e.g., manufacturing hardwearing soft magnetic parts with complex geometry.}, number={6}, journal={Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics}, author={Fu, Yingqing and Pan, Zhoujian and Li, Liyue and Wang, Haiming and Zhao, Lei and Liu, Changhao and Li, Chao and Zhu, Liangyu}, year={2023}, month=feb, pages={468}, language={en} }

In this study, the shape, size and characteristics of different thermal zones and the microstructural evolution during electron beam melting and welding of Vacoflux-49 material are studied. The experimental studies on melting have been carried out with under-focussed, focussed and over focussed electron beam. In the case of the under-focussed and over-focused beam, no evaporated zone is found. In the case of focussed beam, a shallow conical-shaped evaporated zone, a choked funnel-shaped fusion zone, a conical shaped partially melted zone and the heat-affected zone are observed. The solidified melt pool in terms of shape, size and microstructure of different zones are investigated for the focussed beam. The grains in the fusion zone appear wavy having crest and trough. The fusion zone microstructure also shows the formation of solidification rings. From the electron beam welding experiments performed for joining two Vacoflux-49 plates (continuous welding), it is found that the weldment shape is similar to the spot melting and re-solidification experiments. The grain growth in different zones in the welding sample is also examined.}, journal={Archives of Metallurgy and Materials}, year={2023}, month=jul, language={en} }

Recent advancements in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique, provided a new pathway for constructing fully dense, structurally sound, complex-shaped components from bulk equiatomic Co-Fe in a single process step. To obtain the desirable soft magnetic performance in the alloy, thermal postprocessing with a controlled slow cooling needs to be applied. In order to identify the optimum heating conditions, several single and multiple step heat treatment profiles were performed and compared. The effects of the thermal post-processing on the microstructure, structural ordering, and functional properties of the alloy after each heat treatment were investigated using electron microscopy, neutron diffraction (ND), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and quasi-static magnetic characterisation in a closed loop magnetic circuit. Results have shown that a normalisation heat treatment at 1300 K for 2-hours followed by a 4-hour primary heat treatment at 1123 K and slow cooling to room temperature produced a recrystallised microstructure characterised by predominantly equiaxed grains with an average size of up to 61 µm, and a fully ordered B2 structure. The quasi-static soft magnetic properties obtained were favourable compared to those of commercial Co-Fe grades, with maximum relative permeability higher than 8000, coercivity as low as 112 A/m and magnetic saturation polarization of 2.39 Tesla. These findings provide the basis to enable the manufacturing of three-dimensional complex-shaped electromagnetic cores by LPBF.}, journal={Additive Manufacturing}, author={Liogas, Konstantinos A. and Lau, Kwang Boon and Wang, Zifan and Brown, David N. and Polatidis, Efthymios and Wang, Pei and Korsunsky, Alexander M.}, year={2023}, month=apr, pages={103499}, language={en} }

Several welding processes exist that can achieve this layered deposition strategy. Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) derived processes are commonly favored for their high deposition rates (1–4 kg/h) and minimal torch reorientation required during deposition. A range of GMAW processes are available; all of which have different material transfer modes and thermal energy input ranges and the resultant metallic structures formed from these processes can vary in their mechanical properties and morphology. This work will investigate single-layer deposition and vary the process parameters and process mode to observe responses in mechanical properties, bead geometry and deposition rate. The process modes selected for this study were GMAW derived process of Metal Inert Gas (MIG) and Cold Metal Transfer (CMT). Characterization of parameter sets revealed relationships between torch travel speeds, wire feed speeds and the specimen properties and proportions. Differences were observed in the cross-sectional bead geometry and deposition rates when comparing MIG and CMT samples though the inﬂuence of process mode on mechanical properties was less signiﬁcant compared to process parameter selection.}, number={10}, journal={Metals}, author={Stinson, Harley and Ward, Richard and Quinn, Justin and McGarrigle, Cormac}, year={2021}, month=sep, pages={1530}, language={en} }

Since heat transaction in the AM process can control the thermal-field generated through continuous heat deposition. Therefore, the present study focuses on the critical review of multi-physics continuum modelling of WAAM at a macro-scale level.

It is increasingly being used worldwide to reduce costs and time. Generally, AM technology is used to overcome the limitations of traditional subtractive manufacturing (SM) for fabricating large-scale components with lower buy-to-fly ratios. There are three heat sources commonly used in WAAM: metal inert gas welding (MIG), tungsten inert gas welding (TIG), and plasma arc welding (PAW). MIG is easier and more convenient than TIG and PAW because it uses a continuous wire spool with the welding torch. Unlike MIG, tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) and plasma arc welding (PAW) need an external wire feed machine to supply the additive materials. WAAM is gaining popularity in the fabrication of 3D metal components, but the process is hard to control due to its inherent residual stress and distortion, which are generated by the high thermal input from its heat sources. Distortion and residual stress are always a challenge for WAAM because they can affect the component’s geometric accuracy and drastically degrade the mechanical properties of the components. In this paper, wire-based and wire arc technology processes for 3D metal printing, including their advantages and limitations are reviewed. The optimization parametric study and modification of WAAM to reduce both residual stress and distortion are tabulated, summarized, and discussed.}, number={3}, journal={International Journal of Automation Technology}, author={Li, Johnnieew Zhong and Alkahari, Mohd Rizal and Rosli, Nor Ana Binti and Hasan, Rafidah and Sudin, Mohd Nizam and Ramli, Faiz Redza and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka Hang Tuah Jaya, Durian Tunggal, Melaka 76100, Malaysia and Center of Advanced Research on Energy, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Melaka, Malaysia}, year={2019}, month=may, pages={346–353}, language={en} }
