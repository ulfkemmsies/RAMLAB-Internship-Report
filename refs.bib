	abstract = {A Vaporizing Liquid Micro-thruster using a wavy microchannel design is analyzed with a CFD simulation of the liquid water flow. Gains in the convective performance of the channel when compared to an equivalent straight microchannel are found to be limited at low Reynolds numbers. Pressure losses are found to be negligible. Finally, some considerations on possible future work on this subject are made.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the modeling of micropropulsion systems based on the vaporization of a liquid. The model combines analytical and empirical relations derived from extensive experimental analysis and fundamental physical laws. This allows modeling of key parameters, such as mass ﬂow rate, for the entire system comprising a tank to store the liquid propellant, a valve to control the mass ﬂow, and a microthruster that vaporizes the propellant and accelerates it generating thrust. The model is evaluated by a sensitivity analysis considering the boundaries of the modeling space and it has been tested in a simulation loop demonstrating the attitude control of a nano-satellite using a set of four thrusters. The results of the simulation are used to test the developed model.},
