The Taguchi method and ANOVA were used to determine the effects of travel speed, wire feed rate, current, and argon flow rate on the responses including bead shape and size, bead roughness, oxidation levels, melt through depth, and the microstructure. Travel speed and current were found to have the largest effect on the responses. Increasing travel speed or decreasing current caused a decrease in melt through depth and an increase in roughness. Printing strategies were tested using specimens of multiple layers and no significant difference was found between printing layers in the same direction and printing layers in alternating directions. No observable interface between the layers was present suggesting a complete fusion between layers with no oxidation. Three distinct zones were identified within the three- and eightlayer samples. The zones were characterized by the size and distribution of the molybdenum carbide formations within the matrix grain formations.}, journal={Additive Manufacturing}, author={Dinovitzer, Malcolm and Chen, Xiaohu and Laliberte, Jeremy and Huang, Xiao and Frei, Hanspeter}, year={2019}, month=mar, pages={138â€“146}, language={en} }
